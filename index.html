    <h1>WELCOME KEVIN PERSON</h1>
    
    
    <p>I am a 31 year old step father to the greatest kid ever and husband to the 
        greatest woman I have ever known outside of my immediate family. They are my bio besides me being a
        US Army veteran and currently getting into roofing as a 2nd career. I have love for a few sports 
        including baseball, basketball, boxing, ufc, and football.

        My Favorite Movies List would be:
            - All the Conjurings
            - Hangover 2
            - All Fridays
            - Think Like A Man 1 & 2
            - Lion King
            - The Dark Knight
            - I can do this one all day lol I probably should start reading more books </p>
